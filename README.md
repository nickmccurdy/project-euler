project-euler
=============

My solutions to [Project Euler](http://projecteuler.net/problems) problems. They are mostly written in Ruby, but some use Common Lisp, Haskell, or Rust.

__Note__: Running my Ruby solutions may require development versions of
[magician](https://github.com/nicolasmccurdy/magician) (from GitHub, not RubyGems).
